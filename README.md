# convolution-in-2d
convolving a 2d image for edge detection in c

This code takes in an image that has been processed from .png, .jpeg, etc to .bin. This was done in Matlab. 
After the edge detection convolution, the result is placed into an output .bin file to be converted back to an image in Matlab.

This currently only works for a grayscale (1 dimensional) image.
